# 4.5 Turning the ViT patch embedding layer into a PyTorch module
# Time to put everything we've done for creating the patch embedding into a single PyTorch layer.
# We can do so by subclassing nn.Module and creating a small PyTorch "model" to do all of the steps above.
# Specifically we'll:
# Create a class called PatchEmbedding which subclasses nn.Module (so it can be used a PyTorch layer).
# Initialize the class with the parameters in_channels=3, patch_size=16 (for ViT-Base) and embedding_dim=768 (this is  ùê∑  for ViT-Base from Table 1).
# Create a layer to turn an image into patches using nn.Conv2d() (just like in 4.3 above).
# Create a layer to flatten the patch feature maps into a single dimension (just like in 4.4 above).
# Define a forward() method to take an input and pass it through the layers created in 3 and 4.
# Make sure the output shape reflects the required output shape of the ViT architecture ( ùëÅ√ó(ùëÉ2‚ãÖùê∂) ).
